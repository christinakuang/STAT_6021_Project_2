***Group Expectations Agreement***

We have agreed to adopt the following expectations for this project: 

***• Mode of communication between group members: ***
We will use slack to communicate as a group. Trey will set up the slack channel. 

***• How to schedule meetings:***
Christina Kuang will set up a "WhenToMeet" poll to agree on regular meeting times so that the largest proportion of the group is able to meet each time. 

***• How to conduct meetings:***
We will meet via zoom and take turns sharing our screens. 

***• How to handle disagreements:***
We will hold a vote for disagreements; majority 'wins'. 

***• In addition, we have assigned the following group member roles:***

***Organizer:*** The organizer is tasked to keep the group on track and to guide the meeting back on track if the discussion goes off tangent. 
***Chi Do ***

***Recorder:*** The recorder is tasked with documenting the group's questions, discussions, as well as assigned tasks for each group member during a meeting. Using a google doc that is shared among all group members may be a good idea. 
***Greg Madden***

***Checker:*** The checker pauses the discussion from time to time to give everyone in the group a chance to ask questions, raise doubts, seek clarifications, etc. Ensures that everyone is clear about their assigned task. 
***Trey Hamilton***

***Scheduler:*** Group members are expected to give the scheduler a list of times they are available during the week.
